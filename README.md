- 😁 Hi, I’m Kade Illian, a full-stack web developer based out of Bozeman, Montana.
- 👀 I’m interested in Ruby on Rails, React.js, improving the quality of online maps using code, and enjoying the great outdoors.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build a personal website using Rails from scratch, user authentication, and database design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building web scrapers, helping others with their Rails projects, and eventually creating a cost of living app using a large variety of web scrapers.
- 📫 You can reach me through my [Github](www.github.com/kadeillian21), my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kade-illian/), or through my personal website [kadeillian.com](www.kadeillian.com)!
